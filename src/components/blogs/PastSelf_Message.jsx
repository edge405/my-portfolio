      <p className="text-xl font-bold">Dear Past Me,</p>
      <p className="text-xl my-5">
        I want you to know that you are doing great, even if it doesn't feel
        like it sometimes. Life is a journey, and every step you take is part of
        your growth and development as a person, so keep going!. If I could sit
        with you for a moment, these are the five things I’d want you to hear:
      </p>
      <p className="text-3xl font-bold text-center">Be kind to yourself</p>
      <p className="text-xl my-5">
        I know you're very stressed when life gets tough or life doesn't go as
        planned. I know you tend to blame yourself and carry more than you
        should. Remember that it's okay to make mistakes. Mistakes are a part of
        life, and they help you learn and grow. Be gentle with yourself, and
        don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it.
      </p>
      <p className="text-3xl font-bold text-center">
        Don't think what other people think
      </p>
      <p className="text-xl my-5">
        Sometimes you rely too much on what others say about you. I know their
        opinions can be helpful and give you new perspectives, but don’t let
        them control how you see yourself. Remember, their words don’t define
        your worth or your path. Be mindful of what you take in, trust your own
        heart, and believe in your strength. You are doing better than you
        realize, and your journey is yours alone to shape.
      </p>
      <p className="text-3xl font-bold text-center">Do it at your own pace</p>
      <p className="text-xl my-5">
        Don’t try to copy someone else’s process or their learning phase, doing
        that can ruin your growth and trap you in a never ending loop. It’s okay
        to take your time and move at your own pace. Trust your own rhythm,
        listen to your heart, and remember that every small step forward is
        progress worth celebrating.
      </p>
      <p className="text-3xl font-bold text-center">Take care of your body</p>
      <p className="text-xl my-5">
        You often turn to unhealthy foods when you’re stressed. But your body
        deserves kindness and care. Try to eat healthy foods and exercise every
        day, because the results are worth it. Taking care of your body will
        give you more energy, clearer thoughts, and a stronger spirit to face
        whatever comes your way.
      </p>
      <p className="text-3xl font-bold text-center">Take risk</p>
      <p className="text-xl my-5">
        Challenges may feel overwhelming at first, but they don’t last forever.
        With time, things will get easier so don’t be afraid to face them head
        on. You missed many opportunities, and don't wait for regret not
        grabbing them when you had the chance. It’s okay to feel unsure or
        awkward in the beginning, that’s how growth starts. Trust the process
        and always have faith.
      </p>

      <p className="text-xl my-5">
        With love,
        <br />
        <p className="text-xl font-bold">Your Future Self</p>
      </p>
    </div>
