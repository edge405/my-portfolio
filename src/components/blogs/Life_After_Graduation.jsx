        June 11, 2025. This is the day where I graduated, I felt so accomplished
        and ready for the corporate world! Since I have skills and have also won
        3 consecutive coding competitions + hackathons, I expected that I could
        land a job easily. But the reality was different, and I want to share
        with you my 30th day after graduation.

        The excitement
      </h2>
      <p className="text-xl">
        On the first week after graduation. The excitement really kicked in. I
        kept thinking about what kind of job or company would accept me in tech.
        I was very confident about web developer role since I have a hands on
        experience creating robust web applications. That week, I've created a
        website portfolio then my resume. I've also created a LinkedIn, Indeed,
        and Jobstreet profile. I felt ready and hyped I told myself, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs spam
        these applications!‚ÄùüòÑ

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-5 mb-2 text-center">Realization</h2>
      <p className="text-xl">
        After applying to several companies, I realized that the tech industry
        is not as easy as I thought. I wasn‚Äôt getting responses, and when I did,
        the messages often included the word "Unfortunately". I kept wondering
        wasn‚Äôt winning coding competition, hackathons, and building projects
        supposed to give me a headstart? It felt like all my efforts weren‚Äôt
        enough. I started doubting myself and my skills. At one point, it even
        felt like spending four years learning computer science was a waste of
        time. All the excitements I had before were gone. I was just sitting in
        my room, staring at my computer screen, feeling empty and unmotivated.
        Asking myself, "What now? What should I do next? Should I pursue a
        career in tech?" This questions goes into my head everynight. I cried
        and felt stuck, unsure of everything I once believed in.

        I stopped opening job sites for a while. I ignored my gmail. I felt like
        everyone was moving forward while I was stuck in the same spot, unsure
        and afraid. But even in those quiet, painful moments, a small part of me
        still wanted to keep going. I didn‚Äôt know how, or when, but deep down, I
        didn‚Äôt want to give up. And maybe‚Ä¶ that was enough for now.
