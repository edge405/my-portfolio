      <h2>The Beginning of My DevOps Journey</h2>
      <p>
        My transition from full-stack development to DevOps wasn't planned—it
        happened organically as I became more interested in the infrastructure
        that powers our applications. What started as curiosity about deployment
        processes evolved into a passion for automation and reliability.
      </p>

      <h2>Why the Transition Made Sense</h2>
      <p>
        As a full-stack developer, I was constantly frustrated by deployment
        issues and environment inconsistencies. I found myself spending more
        time troubleshooting infrastructure problems than writing code. This led
        me to dive deeper into containerization, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud
        platforms.
      </p>

      <h2>Key Skills I Developed</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Containerization:</strong> Docker became my best friend for
          ensuring consistency across environments
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Infrastructure as Code:</strong> Terraform and CloudFormation
          helped me manage cloud resources programmatically
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>CI/CD Pipelines:</strong> Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and GitLab
          CI transformed how I think about deployments
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Monitoring & Observability:</strong> Prometheus, Grafana, and
          ELK stack became essential tools
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Challenges I Faced</h2>
      <p>
        The learning curve was steep. Moving from application code to
        infrastructure code required a different mindset. I had to learn about
        networking, security, scalability, and reliability in ways I never had
        to as a developer.
      </p>

      <h2>The Reward</h2>
      <p>
        Today, I can build, deploy, and maintain applications end-to-end. The
        satisfaction of creating robust, scalable systems that developers can
        rely on is incredibly fulfilling. DevOps has made me a better developer
        and given me a deeper appreciation for the entire software lifecycle.
      </p>

      <h2>Advice for Developers Considering DevOps</h2>
      <p>
        If you're curious about DevOps, start small. Pick one area—maybe
        containerization or CI/CD—and dive deep. The skills are transferable,
        and understanding infrastructure will make you a more well-rounded
        developer regardless of your career path.
